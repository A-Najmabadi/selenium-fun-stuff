# selenium-fun-stuff
You can start by visit_google.py to learn how we can go to google.com without hand intervention 😉

Then working with googling-selenium is a good practice to accustom selenium features ...

After these, you can run github-exploring.py file to explore github with our lovely friend, selenium 🤗

There is a mini-creepy.py file too, this file inserts all the links on first page of github.com into a table using sqlite3

Use Google it Weirdly to Google it Weirdly 😆 

Instagram.py file needs to items: first, username.txt file which includes a real username on instagram, second, password.txt file 
which is password of username (NOTE: you must create these two files to run this program successfully!). After Running this Program,
it Logs you in instagram, then goes to #python page, after that, scrolls 3 times, then goes into posts related to specific hashtag,
then follows the user's post, likes (or unlike if it liked before) and comments << Woow Dude >> for that post. Try this for fun.

At LAST, we have a gardoone.py file, this file can be used by Iranian People, so I wrote this in Persian:
این برنامه وارد گردونه سایت دانشجویار میشود، ایمیل های رندوم غیر حقیقی را وارد میکند و سپس دکمه تایید را کلیک میکند
بعد از آن، کد هایی را که گردونه به ما میدهد، در صورت تکراری نبودن به همراه ایمیل وارد شدهف وارد جدول تخفیف میکند
این برنامه از کتابخانه های تایم و اس کیو لایت سه نیز افزون بر سلنیوم، استفاده کرده است
امید است که از این برنامه لذت برده باشد
